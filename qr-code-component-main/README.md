## My process

### Built with

- Semantic(ish) HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project, while not my first exposure to either HTML or CSS, definitely provided me with a new chance to use them and build a page more from scratch rather than editing existing pages as I have in the past. Some skills I was able to take away from this challenge were positioning using css elements, the idea of border-radius to soften edges within a page, and importing custom fonts.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to get a better grasp on positioning of elements and get more comfortable with pages with multiple elements. I also am looking to expand to a seperate .css file in a future project rather than just spacing the styling out within a <style> division under the head of the html file.
